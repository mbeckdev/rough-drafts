# rough-drafts
For those many little projects that I might split off and make into their own repo one day

I don't know if this is good practice at all, but I'm making code and no one knows I did. I want some github green square credit for my effort. Hopefully seeing those green squares will be some good motivation to keep going and one day be the awesome developer of my dreams!
